# 4. Request a project folder with limited access to those listed in the ethics application

With the sensitive nature of neuroimaging data, ensuring strict access control is crucial. By requesting a project folder with limited access, you're taking a proactive step in data protection. Only those individuals listed in the ethics application — typically members of the research team with a direct role in data handling — should have access to this folder.

Implementing this level of control not only aligns with data protection guidelines but also minimizes potential data breaches. Furthermore, it maintains the integrity of the research process, as only authorized individuals can interact with the data, reducing the risk of unintentional data manipulation or misuse.
