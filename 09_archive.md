# 9. Minimise personal data

In line with best practices for data privacy and protection, it's imperative to minimize the amount of personal data associated with the neuroimaging datasets. This not only reduces potential risks for participants but also ensures compliance with data protection regulations.

Personal identifiers should be replaced with pseudonyms or coded IDs, ensuring that the data can't be traced back to individual participants without the decryption key. All unnecessary personal information should be stripped from the data before proceeding to further analysis or sharing.
