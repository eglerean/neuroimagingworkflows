# Collecting data at ANI and recruiting participants

## Aalto Neuroimaging Infrastructure (ANI)
The Aalto Neuroimaging Infrastructure (ANI) is a state-of-the-art facility designed to support advanced neuroimaging studies. Once all preliminary steps are complete, you are now poised to collect data at ANI. When using such sophisticated equipment, it's vital to ensure you're familiar with the facility's protocols, machine operation guidelines, and safety procedures.

Data collection at ANI promises high-quality, high-resolution imaging data. Ensuring your participants are comfortable, informed, and prepared for the scanning process will result in more consistent data and a smoother collection phase. Regular communication with ANI staff and technicians can also assist in troubleshooting and optimizing your data acquisition strategy.

## Recruiting participants for brain studies

We do not have a stric procedure on how to advertise brain imaging studies. In the past people have used department lists, flyers, word of mouth, own network. It is more challenging of course when a specific population needs to be recruited. It is also important to remember that while MRI is a safe technology, not all individuals should enter a room with an MRI device. It is important to make sure that your participant does not have any metal in the body, pace makers, and other cases listed here ADDLINK.

It is good to send to the study participants all three documents (privacy notice, consent to participate, self test for MRI safety) before booking a scanning session with them.
