# Run preprocessing and other analyses using scratch storage, backup scripts on project
:::{note}
In this page, we delve into utilizing scratch storage for preprocessing and analysis, and the importance of backing up scripts.
:::

Scratch storage is optimal for running data-intensive operations like preprocessing. Given its temporary nature, it's crucial to ensure that analysis scripts and significant interim results are backed up in the project directory. This ensures continuity in research workflows and safeguards against potential data loss.
