# 2. Prepare the privacy notice and study information sheet

Before you embark on any data collection, especially in neuroimaging where personal and potentially sensitive data is handled, it's paramount to prepare a comprehensive privacy notice and study information sheet. These documents inform participants about the nature of the research, what will happen to their data, and how their privacy will be maintained.

The privacy notice specifically outlines how personal data will be used, stored, and protected, ensuring participants' rights under data protection regulations. The study information sheet, on the other hand, provides a broader overview of the research, detailing the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits.
