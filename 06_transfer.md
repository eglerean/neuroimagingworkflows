# 6. Transfer data from ANI to the project folder

Once data collection at ANI is complete, the next step is the safe and secure transfer of this data to the designated project folder. This process is critical to ensure data integrity and privacy. It's advisable to use encrypted methods of transfer to prevent potential breaches or interception.

While transferring, be mindful of the folder structure and naming conventions. Consistency in these aspects will aid in the efficient organization and subsequent analysis of the data. Regular checks and verifications during this phase can prevent data loss or mismatches.
