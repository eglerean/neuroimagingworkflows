Neuroimaging Workflows at Aalto University
==========================================

*A pocket size handbook for conducting neuroimaging studies at Aalto*

This Neuroimaging Workflows Handbook offers a practical guide to the steps to conduct neuroimaging research at Aalto University. Structured around key stages—from pre-registration to data analysis and publication—this handbook is designed as a go-to reference for both new and experienced neuroscientists. 

This handbook describes a typical process for neuroimaging studies at Aalto, but it does not force the researcher to follow each step rigorously. This handbook tries to document the tacit knowledge that is often passed from researcher to researcher in a more structured way to highlight the advantages (and drawbacks) of each stage of the research process. If your research workflow is slightly different than the one described here, please let us know so we can expand the documentation.
