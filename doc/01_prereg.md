# 1. Pre-register your study hypotheses and methodological choices

## About
Pre-registering your study hypotheses and methodological choices is an essential first step in the neuroimaging research process. It ensures transparency and promotes robust, reproducible research. By detailing your hypotheses, methods, and analyses before data collection begins, you minimize the risk of p-hacking and data dredging. This practice not only aligns with the best principles of open science but also establishes credibility and trust in the research community.

Furthermore, pre-registration can help in streamlining the research process. When study objectives and methods are clear from the outset, it becomes easier to align resources, equipment, and participants accordingly.
