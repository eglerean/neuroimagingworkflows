# Prepare the data into BIDS format ensuring data minimisation

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format is a standard in neuroimaging that allows for efficient organization, sharing, and analysis of datasets. When preparing your data in the BIDS format, it's crucial to ensure that data minimization principles are maintained.

This means that while structuring data according to BIDS, any remaining personal identifiers or unnecessary metadata should be excluded. The BIDS format, with its clear guidelines and conventions, not only streamlines the data processing pipeline but also promotes transparency and reproducibility in neuroimaging research.
